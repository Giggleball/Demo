// Phase #1
// Create a web form where people can input their retirement plans
// Requirements:
// * The page uses a framework like bootstrap/materialize
// * The user can input all variables used in the compound interest exercise
// * The form uses POST as a method for security reasons

// Phase #2
// After the user submits the form, display their retirement statistics
// Requirements:
// * After submitting the form, nodejs calculates the pension statistics and pug displays them
// * The results are personalised (e.g. "Hello Mentor! Your retirement options look like this:")
// * All scenarios (optimistic, neutral, pessimistic) are displayed

// Phase #3
// The user predicts a x% (for example 5%) increase of invested income every year, add this to your app

// Phase #4
// The interest of invested money fluctiates randomly between the pessimistic and optimistic values each year. 
// Add a 'simulate reality' option to your form that calculates a possible pension based on these random values.

// Phase #5
// The S&P 500 is an index fund known by investors worldwide. Create a separate page that allows you to calculate 
// how much money you would have retired with if you invested in the S&P 500 from 1950 to 2015. You will need this 
// historical data: http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/New_Home_Page/datafile/histretSP.html
// The form on the page should allow you to fill in all the usual values, but the interest rates are instead based 
// on the historical data.

// Phase #UB3RL33T
// Modify this whole app to run client side, so purely in chrome.
